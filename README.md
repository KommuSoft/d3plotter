# d3plotter

A set of plotting scripts that are used to plot (default) graphs with `d3.js`. The package furthermore offers ways to convert certain `.csv` data in one data format to another format.

The `.js` library is located in [`d3plotter/public_html/d3plotter.js`](https://github.com/KommuSoft/d3plotter/blob/master/d3plotter/public_html/d3plotter.js). The data format converters are located at [`converters`](https://github.com/KommuSoft/d3plotter/blob/master/converters).

## Documentations and Samples

Documentation and samples for each plotter function can be found [here](https://github.com/KommuSoft/d3plotter/blob/master/d3plotter/public_html/samples.md).
