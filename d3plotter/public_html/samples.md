# Samples

This page contains samples that document the functions implemented in `d3plotter.js` a (higher level) library that provides common commands to plot `.csv` data.

This sample page lists the provided methods together with an example and notes on how to use the function as well as how it is implemented.

Some of the plotters are interactive. Since the plots are generated with JavaScript on the webpage (and not binaries containing the expected result), the interaction works on this page as well.
